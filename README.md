# About Taurit.Toolkit.Hostlists

## Contents of this repo

This is a repo that helps me sync my domain blacklists and whitelists.

I tend to use those lists to block access to some domains on my devices with use of tools like:

* _PiHole_ on Raspberry Pi
* _personalDnsFilter_ on Android

**I do not recommend reusing those blacklists** by anyone, as they are heavily **personalized** and are in public repo just for my convenience.

## Disclaimer

None of the content here intends to be offensive. For example, I classify some sites as *Tabloids* for my convenience in management of those domain lists. It's not intended as an offense to the journalists or a political statement of any sort ;)
